# Sexier folder tree for Visual Studio Code
Purely style enhancements - indentation, vertical folder lines, etc.

# How To Apply

- Open `[vscode-install-dir]\resources\app\out\vs\workbench\workbench.main.css` and add the contents of [style.css](style.css) at the bottom.
- reload vscode. It will complain that it's "broken" - just hit "Don't Show Again".
